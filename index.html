            <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Joakim.</p>
                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>For over a year now, I have been deeply immersed in the world of programming. During this time, I have developed a strong foundation in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>Css</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Node</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Professional background</h3>
                    <p>Before venturing into programming, I worked as a plumber for 12 years. During the last 2 years of my plumbing career, I took on the role of a project manager. This experience allowed me to step up my skills as a salesman and develop strong project management capabilities.</p>
                <h3>My new path</h3>
                    <p>I decided to shift my career to something more rewarding and aligned with my passions. Programming offers the perfect blend of creativity and problem-solving that I find deeply fulfilling.</p>
                <h3>Looking forward</h3>
                    <p>I am excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to bring my diverse skill set to new and challenging projects.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>In my free time, I immerse myself in programming, a passion that has become a central part of my evenings and weekends since I began learning this skill. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and continuously improving my coding abilities. This hobby not only sharpens my analytical thinking but also provides a great sense of accomplishment when I overcome technical obstacles.</p>
                <h3>Love of travel</h3>
                    <p>Beyond programming, I am an avid traveler. Exploring new destinations and experiencing diverse cultures enriches my perspective and fuels my curiosity about the world. I find that traveling broadens my horizons and inspires creativity in my work and personal life.</p>
                <h3>Keeping myself fit</h3>
